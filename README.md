# StarterKit

This ScaleFT Starter Kit is here so you can easily build out environments with different configurations and see ScaleFT features in action.
 
Each directory in this repository is a self-contained terraform project which demonstrates an individual use case of ScaleFT. Each example requires the same basic configuration setup in ScaleFT, described [here](https://www.scaleft.com/docs/setup/initial-configuration/). If you've already set these things up, no need to do it again.

These examples are written using AWS. To use these examples, a current AWS account & credentials will be required. 

:dollar: A small number of resources will be created in AWS, which may cost some money. Please delete them when you're done. :money_with_wings: 

Check out the individual READMEs below to see how:

* [Single CentOS Server](centos-alone/)
